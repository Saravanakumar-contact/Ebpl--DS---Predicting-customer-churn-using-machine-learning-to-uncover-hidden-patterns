# Customer Churn Prediction App

This app allows users to upload a customer churn dataset (CSV), preprocess the data, train multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`.
3. Upload a CSV file containing customer data (must include a target column named 'Churn').
4. Select a model and view the results.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit app script.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
